Build a systematic trading engine that uses real-time market microstructure data from a public API, generates alpha signals, and simulates algorithmic trade execution based on those signals.  Project Goals:
1. Ingest and process high-frequency data.
2. Engineer features relevant to execution quality and trading signals.
3. Implement and backtest a signal-based strategy.
4. Simulate a smart order router (SOR) for execution.
5. Visualize results with PnL breakdowns, latency impacts, slippage, and VWAP comparisons.
 Project Components:
1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
* Connect to Polygon/Exchange API.
* Pull Level 2 order book data, trades, bid/ask spreads, volumes.
* Resample into 1s/5s/1m bars with microstructure metrics:
    * Order book imbalance
    * Spread % width
    * Trade aggressor side
    * Hidden liquidity proxy
2. Alpha Signal Generation
* Use features to predict short-term price movements (1–5 second horizon).
* Train models:
    * Logistic regression / XGBoost / Random Forest
    * Classify PriceUp, PriceDown, Flat
* Add feature importance analysis.
3. Backtesting Engine
* Build or use backtrader to simulate signal-based strategy.
* Compare naive execution vs. signal-enhanced entry (e.g., wait for tighter spread or higher buy imbalance).
* Track execution cost, slippage, VWAP performance.
4. Execution Model
* Implement basic execution strategies:
    * Market order
    * Limit order with intelligent placement (based on imbalance)
    * TWAP/VWAP simulation
5. Evaluation and Visualization
* Plot:
    * Signal accuracy (confusion matrix)
    * Strategy equity curve
    * PnL vs. benchmark
    * Execution metrics (slippage, fill ratio, latency impact)
* Create a streamlit dashboard for live demo.
Integrate Reinforcement Learning for execution policy optimization.
Connect to paper trading API (e.g. Alpaca) for live testing.
Add cross-asset signals (e.g., crypto and equities correlation).
 Tools & Libraries:
* Python (preferred): pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, ccxt, matplotlib, plotly, backtrader or bt, TA-Lib
* APIs: Polygon.io, Binance, or IEX Cloud (free tiers or sandbox available)
* Optional R: quantmod, TTR, tidyquant, PerformanceAnalytics
